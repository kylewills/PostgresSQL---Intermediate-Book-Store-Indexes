# PROJECT---Intermediate-Book-Store-Indexes

Advanced PostgreSQL

------------------

This is a codecademy project where I was required to examine, analise and add indexes where required'
It is an online book store and need to keep track of what books we offer. Weâ€™ll be working with a database of three tables.
The aim of the project was to look at how adding more complex indexes can help (or hurt!) the database.
